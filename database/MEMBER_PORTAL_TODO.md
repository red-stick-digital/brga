# Member Portal Implementation - Todo List

**Last Updated**: 2025 - Phase: Auth Flow Updates (In Progress)

---

## Project Overview

Comprehensive member portal upgrade for Baton Rouge GA with approval codes, member profiles, and admin management.

**Key Technical Decisions**:

- âœ… `start_time` field uses TIME type for future scheduling features
- âœ… Three-word approval codes (e.g., "fish-taco-burrito") for user-friendly signup
- âœ… `approval_status` field in user_roles unifies permissions and member status
- âœ… Members can opt-in to directory visibility for privacy

**Database Status**: âœ… Schema deployed, seed data loaded, RLS policies configured, superadmin created
