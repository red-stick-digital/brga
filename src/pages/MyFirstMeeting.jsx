                        We tend to see the same faces at meetings each week, so it's very likely someone will ask if you are a new member or if it's your first meeting. We provide new members with literature packets and take a little extra time to explain various parts of the meeting. Some meetings will also forego their planned discussion topic when there are new members and instead, members will share their "story" with the group. These stories usually consist of the member's history with gambling, the impact it has had on their life, what led them to seek help, and how they are doing since beginning the recovery program. Many of our new members find they can relate to something from everyone's story. You may be asked if you would like to share, it is your choice whether you want to share or not. Do not feel pressured to speak at your first meeting.

                    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        As an anonymous organization, GA works on a first-name basis only. Before speaking, each member introduces themselves by stating their first name, such as "Hi! My name is Jim." Many members also choose to identify themselves as a compulsive gambler; for example, "My name is Ann and I am a compulsive gambler." It is up to you to decide how you would like to introduce yourself - there is no right or wrong way - we only ask that you introduce yourself before speaking. If you are questioning whether you are a compulsive gambler or not, you may choose to say your name and "I'm glad to be here."

                    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        When GA members talk about their thoughts, feelings, and experiences during a meeting, we call it "sharing". Each member chooses to share as much or as little as they want during a meeting. Some members choose not to share at all. In order to maintain a respectful and safe environment for members to share, we have a few guidelines we expect all members to follow:
                    </p>

                    <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4 text-gray-700">
                        <li>
                            <span className="font-semibold">Cross Talk Is Discouraged</span> - Cross-talk is defined as interrupting, giving advice or making comments directly to another member about their share. It is also talking to another member or making distracting noise during the meeting. Some meetings are more rigid about cross-talk and others are more relaxed. We recommend refraining from cross-talk until you have been able to observe or ask about what is acceptable at a specific meeting.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span className="font-semibold">All comments should be related to recovery from gambling addiction and should focus on our own experience</span> - We are here to share our experience, strength and hope so that we can help each other recover from a gambling addiction. While sharing our experience does include aspects of our gambling history, we want to refrain from sharing "war stories", specific win/loss amounts, or opinions on outside issues. We also need to talk about our own experiences, not others.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span className="font-semibold">Insensitive or offensive comments will not be tolerated</span> - A GA meeting is intended to be a judgment-free zone for members. We will never tolerate comments that are disparaging to another member, or to groups of people based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religious or political affiliation, etc. While our members are entitled to their personal opinions, a GA meeting is not the place to express them. Anyone making offensive comments may be asked to leave the meeting and may not be welcome back.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span className="font-semibold">Every member should have an opportunity to share during a meeting</span> - Be respectful of the time constraints of the meeting and limit your share to 5 minutes or less depending on the number of people attending and the duration of the meeting. Everyone should have an opportunity to share.
                        </li>
