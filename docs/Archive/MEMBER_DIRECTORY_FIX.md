**User Email**: marsh11272@yahoo.com  
**User Role**: SUPERADMIN (Verified in Supabase)  
**Status**: CONFIRMED - DO NOT ASK TO VERIFY AGAIN

The first and last step of every agent action is to update the relevant .md file regarding the work in progress. Keep track of every attempt at troubleshooting or debugging issues that we encounter.

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED UPGRADES

### 1. Database Schema Updates (member_portal_schema.sql)

- ‚úÖ Added `share_phone_in_directory` (BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE) column
- ‚úÖ Added `share_email_in_directory` (BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE) column
- ‚úÖ Added `officer_position` (TEXT with CHECK constraint) column with enum options:
  - Chairman
  - Vice Chairman
  - Secretary
  - Treasurer
  - Librarian
  - Public Relations
  - Telephone Chair
  - Intergroup Representative

### 2. Profile Form Updates (ProfileForm.jsx)

- ‚úÖ Added form state fields for new database columns
- ‚úÖ Added checkbox: "Share my phone number in the directory"
- ‚úÖ Added checkbox: "Share my email in the directory"
- ‚úÖ Added dropdown for "Officer Position (Optional)" with all 8 positions listed above
- ‚úÖ Created new "Directory Sharing & Service Position" section with descriptive UI
- ‚úÖ Form now saves all new fields to database

### 3. Directory Display Updates (DirectoryMemberCard.jsx)

- ‚úÖ Officer position now displays below member name (if set)
- ‚úÖ Shared phone number displays with formatted display (e.g., (337) 889-8123)
- ‚úÖ Shared email displays with email icon
- ‚úÖ Contact information only shows if member has opted to share it
- ‚úÖ Professional styling with divider between personal info and contact info

### 4. Meeting Week Verification (Meetings.jsx)

- ‚úÖ Confirmed: Meetings page already starts with Monday as first day of week
- ‚úÖ Days properly ordered: Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays

## üìã IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Form Flow

1. When editing profile, members see new "Directory Sharing & Service Position" section
2. They can optionally check boxes to share phone/email
3. They can select an officer position from dropdown (optional)
4. All data is saved along with existing profile fields

### Directory Display

- Officer position badge shows under member name in blue
- Shared contact info displays with icons for phone/email
- Contact information only appears if explicitly shared
- Privacy-respecting: No contact info shows unless member opts in

### Database Considerations

- All new fields have DEFAULT values (FALSE for booleans, NULL for position)
- Existing member records will have NULL/FALSE values for new fields
- CHECK constraint on officer_position ensures data integrity
- RLS policies already in place apply to new columns

## üìÅ FILES MODIFIED

1. **database/member_portal_schema.sql** - Updated schema with new columns, changed `DROP TABLE` to `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` (safe for existing data)
2. **database/migration_add_directory_sharing.sql** - Migration file for adding directory sharing fields to existing databases
3. **database/migration_add_home_groups.sql** - NEW migration file to safely add missing home groups to existing databases
4. **src/components/MemberProfile/ProfileForm.jsx** - Added form fields and state
5. **src/components/Directory/DirectoryMemberCard.jsx** - Added display for shared contact info and officer position
6. **src/hooks/useMemberProfile.js** - Updated to handle new fields in create/update operations

## üîÑ DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

### For Fresh Installations

- Use `database/member_portal_schema.sql` - it includes all new columns and uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` (safe, won't delete data)
- Then run `database/member_portal_seed.sql` to add the 9 home groups

### For Existing Installations

1. Run migrations in this order:

   ```sql
   psql -U your_user -d your_db -f database/migration_add_home_groups.sql
   psql -U your_user -d your_db -f database/migration_add_directory_sharing.sql
   ```

2. Restart application server to pick up schema changes

### For Development

1. Run schema.sql then seed with member_portal_seed.sql to get fresh database with all columns and data
2. Or run migrations individually for testing

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT SCHEMA CHANGE

`member_portal_schema.sql` was updated to use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` instead of `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS`. This ensures existing data is never deleted when running the schema file.

## üîÑ NEXT STEPS (If Needed)

- ‚úÖ Code is ready for deployment
- Deploy schema migration to production Supabase database
- Members can update their profiles with new fields on next edit
- Existing directory will automatically show shared contact info once members update profiles
- Test the form fields and directory display in staging environment
