## COMPLETED STEPS

### ‚úÖ October 23, 2025 - Initial Optimizations

1. **Image Lazy Loading**

   - Added `loading="lazy"` and `decoding="async"` to 9 below-fold images
   - Files modified: `src/pages/Home.jsx`, `src/pages/HelpForGambling.jsx`
   - Estimated savings: ~500KB initial load reduction

2. **Attempted Font Loading Optimization** ‚ùå

   - Tried async font loading with preload
   - **Result**: FAILED - Caused blank page in production
   - **Rolled back**: Reverted to standard font loading

3. **Attempted Advanced Vite Build Configuration** ‚ùå

   - Tried custom asset naming and advanced code splitting
   - **Result**: FAILED - MIME type errors, CSS served as HTML
   - **Error**: `Refused to apply style... MIME type ('text/html') is not a supported stylesheet`
   - **Rolled back**: Reverted to simple Vite config

4. **Working Configuration**

   - Basic code splitting (vendor, supabase, ui bundles)
   - Standard Vite asset paths
   - Image lazy loading active

5. **Self-Hosted Google Fonts** ‚úÖ (Oct 23, 2025 - 8:30 PM)

   - Downloaded League Spartan font files (400, 500, 600, 700 weights)
   - Created local `@font-face` declarations in `/public/fonts/league-spartan-local.css`
   - Removed external Google Fonts requests
   - **Impact**: Eliminates 450ms render blocking time
   - **Commit**: `07cc60b - perf: self-host Google Fonts to eliminate 450ms render blocking`
   - **Files**: `index.html`, `public/fonts/` (5 new files)
   - **Status**: Deployed, awaiting PageSpeed verification

6. **Hero Image Preloading** ‚úÖ (Oct 23, 2025 - 8:40 PM)
   - Added `<link rel="preload" as="image">` for LCP hero image (Home Hand Up.webp, 197KB)
   - Used `fetchpriority="high"` to prioritize loading
   - **Impact**: Expected -0.5 to -1.0s LCP improvement (currently 4.5s ‚Üí target 3.5-4.0s)
   - **Target**: Reach 85+ performance score (currently 78/100, need +7 points)
   - **Files**: `index.html`
   - **Status**: Ready to deploy

## CURRENT STATUS

### Latest PageSpeed Report (Oct 23, 2025 - 8:48 PM) - After Hero Preload

- **URL**: https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-www-batonrougega-org/7bdgew33ev?form_factor=mobile
- **Performance Score**: 77/100 (-1 from previous test, but LCP improved!)
- **FCP**: 3.2s (improved -0.4s from 3.6s) ‚úÖ
- **LCP**: 4.1s (improved -0.4s from 4.5s) ‚úÖ **Hero preload is working!**
- **TBT**: 0ms (excellent - unchanged)
- **CLS**: 0.049 (excellent - unchanged)
- **SI**: 4.7s (newly measured)

### Analysis: Why -1 Point Despite LCP Improvement?

**Good News:**

- ‚úÖ Hero image preload IS WORKING - LCP improved by 0.4s (4.5s ‚Üí 4.1s)
- ‚úÖ FCP also improved by 0.4s (3.6s ‚Üí 3.2s)
- ‚úÖ TBT and CLS remain perfect

**The Trade-off:**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è NEW issue appeared: "Render blocking requests - Est savings of 300ms"
- The preload link itself may be slightly blocking initial render
- **Net effect**: LCP improvement (+points) offset by new render blocking (-points) = -1 total

**Verdict:** This is a typical performance optimization trade-off. The preload helps LCP but adds a small blocking penalty. The -1 point is acceptable since we're prioritizing the hero image (LCP element).

### Current Work Session (Oct 23, 2025 - 8:50 PM)

- ‚úÖ **Hero image preload deployed** - Working! LCP improved 4.5s ‚Üí 4.1s (-0.4s)
- ‚úÖ **Image compression completed** - User optimized 4 large images:
  - `help looking at phone.webp`: 302KB ‚Üí 105KB (-197KB, 65% reduction!)
  - `home three rocks.webp`: 197KB ‚Üí 60KB (-137KB, 70% reduction!)
  - `home bonsai.webp`: 119KB ‚Üí 64KB (-55KB, 46% reduction!)
  - `home head down.webp`: 109KB ‚Üí 98KB (-11KB, 10% reduction!)
  - **Total: ~400KB savings** (way better than the 186KB PageSpeed estimated!)
- üöÄ **Ready to deploy** - Combined preload + image optimization should push score to 82-85+

### Improvements Achieved

- ‚úÖ **+10 points** total performance score increase (68 ‚Üí 78)
- ‚úÖ **+4 points** from self-hosted fonts (74 ‚Üí 78)
- ‚úÖ **Eliminated 450ms** render blocking from Google Fonts
- ‚úÖ **-1.3s** LCP improvement from lazy loading (5.8s ‚Üí 4.5s)
- ‚úÖ **-40ms** TBT improvement (40ms ‚Üí 0ms)
- ‚úÖ Image lazy loading working (9 images)
- ‚úÖ Self-hosted fonts deployed and working

### Remaining Opportunities (To Reach 85+)

1. **Image delivery** - Est. 186 KiB savings üîÑ IN PROGRESS (was 379 KiB!)
   - **Good news**: PageSpeed now estimates only 186KB savings (down from 379KB)
   - Suggests some images are already better optimized than expected
   - Large images still to compress: `help looking at phone.webp` (302KB), `home three rocks.webp` (197KB), `home bonsai.webp` (119KB), `home head down.webp` (109KB)
   - User manually optimizing these now
2. **Render blocking requests** - Est. 300ms savings ‚ö†Ô∏è NEW
   - Hero image preload may be causing slight blocking
   - Could try `media="print" onload="this.media='all'"` trick for fonts
   - **Decision needed**: Keep preload (better LCP) or remove (better FCP)?
3. **Unused JavaScript** - Est. 151 KiB savings (was 150 KiB)
   - Bundle size could be reduced further
   - Tree shaking opportunities
4. **Long main-thread tasks** - 2 tasks found
   - JavaScript execution blocking main thread
   - Consider code splitting or deferring non-critical JS

### Target: 85+ Performance Score

- **Current**: 78/100
- **Goal**: 85+/100
- **Gap**: 7 points to close

## ISSUES ENCOUNTERED

### Issue 1: Async Font Loading Broke Production

- **Date**: Oct 23, 2025
- **Problem**: Using `onload` attribute on font preload caused blank page
- **Root Cause**: JavaScript in font loading interfered with page rendering
- **Solution**: Reverted to standard font loading
- **Commit**: `a5c028a - fix: revert font loading optimization that caused display issues`

### Issue 2: Custom Vite Asset Paths Broke Build

- **Date**: Oct 23, 2025
- **Problem**: CSS file served as HTML, React hooks error
- **Root Cause**: Custom `assetFileNames: 'assets/[ext]/[name]-[hash].[ext]'` broke file serving
- **Console Errors**:
  - `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'useSyncExternalStore')`
  - `MIME type ('text/html') is not a supported stylesheet MIME type`
- **Solution**: Reverted to default Vite asset naming
- **Commit**: `49a67d8 - fix: revert vite build config changes that broke production build`

## NEXT STEPS

### Phase 1: Low-Risk, High-Impact Optimizations (SAFE)

1. [ ] **Self-host Google Fonts** (450ms savings potential)

   - Download League Spartan font files
   - Add to `/public/fonts/` directory
   - Update CSS with `@font-face`
   - **Risk**: Low - no JavaScript, just CSS
   - **Test command**: `npm run build && npm run preview`

2. [ ] **Add font-display: swap to current font loading**

   - Quick CSS-only change
   - Improves perceived performance
   - **Risk**: Very low - single parameter change

3. [ ] **Preload critical assets**
   - Add `<link rel="preload">` for hero images
   - Only for above-the-fold content
   - **Risk**: Low - well-supported feature

### Phase 2: Moderate Optimizations (TEST CAREFULLY)

4. [ ] **Optimize remaining images**

   - Check which images still need WebP conversion
   - Verify file sizes are appropriate
   - **Risk**: Low - same process as before

5. [ ] **Add explicit width/height to images**
   - Reduces CLS
   - Better performance score
   - **Risk**: Very low - just attributes

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations (PROCEED WITH CAUTION)

6. [ ] **Consider route-based code splitting**

   - Lazy load page components with `React.lazy()`
   - Only if comfortable with React patterns
   - **Risk**: Medium - requires testing all routes

7. [ ] **Remove unused CSS/JS**
   - Use Vite's built-in tree shaking
   - Audit dependencies
   - **Risk**: Medium - need to test thoroughly

### Testing Protocol for Each Change

```bash
# 1. Make change
# 2. Test locally
npm run build
npm run preview
# Open localhost:4173 - verify page works

# 3. Check build output
ls -lh dist/assets/

# 4. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "perf: [description of change]"
git push

# 5. Wait 3-5 minutes for deployment
# 6. Test production site
# 7. Run PageSpeed Insights
```

## LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Test production builds locally** - Always run `npm run preview` before deploying
2. **Avoid complex build configurations** - Vite defaults work well, custom configs can break things
3. **JavaScript in HTML attributes is risky** - Especially for critical resources like fonts
4. **One change at a time** - Deploy incrementally to identify what breaks
5. **Monitor console errors** - MIME type and module errors indicate build issues
