## SSL Certificate Error: NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID

**User Report**: "I'm trying to navigate to our site from a work computer. I'm getting an error that says NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID"

**Domain**: batonrougega.org  
**Hosting**: Vercel  
**Date**: October 24, 2025

---

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

The `NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID` error indicates an issue with the SSL certificate on your domain. Based on your deployment setup:

- **Domain**: batonrougega.org
- **Platform**: Vercel hosting
- **Expected**: Automatic SSL via Vercel

---

## LIKELY CAUSES & SOLUTIONS

### 1. **Corporate Network/Firewall Issue (Most Likely)**

**Symptoms**: Error only occurs on work computers, not personal devices

**Root Cause**: Corporate firewalls often perform SSL inspection, replacing legitimate certificates with their own internal CA (Certificate Authority). When the browser sees this unknown CA, it throws the certificate error.

**Solutions**:

- **Short-term**: Ask IT to whitelist `batonrougega.org`
- **Alternative**: Use personal mobile hotspot to bypass corporate network
- **Browser option**: Click "Advanced" → "Proceed to batonrougega.org (unsafe)" (if allowed by IT)

### 2. **Domain SSL Certificate Issues**

**Potential Issues**:

- Vercel SSL certificate hasn't propagated yet
- Domain configuration pointing to wrong servers
- Custom domain not properly configured in Vercel

**Check Steps**:

1. **Verify Certificate Status Online**:

   - Visit: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=batonrougega.org
   - Check certificate validity and configuration

2. **Test from Different Networks**:
   - Try from mobile data (non-corporate network)
   - Try from home internet
   - If works elsewhere = corporate firewall issue

### 3. **Browser/System Issues**

**Less Likely Causes**:

- Outdated browser on work computer
- System date/time incorrect
- Browser cache corruption

**Solutions**:

- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try incognito/private browsing mode
- Try different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

---

## IMMEDIATE DIAGNOSTIC STEPS

### Step 1: Verify Domain SSL Health

```bash
# Test SSL certificate from command line
openssl s_client -connect batonrougega.org:443 -servername batonrougega.org

# Check certificate details
curl -I https://batonrougega.org
```

### Step 2: Network Testing

- **Personal device on same network**: Does error occur?
- **Same device on mobile data**: Does error occur?
- **Home network**: Does error occur?

### Step 3: Vercel Configuration Check

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → brga project
2. Check "Domains" tab
3. Verify `batonrougega.org` shows "Valid Configuration"
4. Check SSL certificate status

---

## MOST LIKELY SCENARIO

**Corporate SSL Inspection**: Your work network is intercepting HTTPS traffic and replacing the legitimate Vercel SSL certificate with an internal corporate certificate that your browser doesn't trust.

**Evidence**: Error only occurs on work computer, not other networks

**Solution**: Contact your IT department and request they whitelist `batonrougega.org` to bypass SSL inspection for this domain.

---

## VERCEL SSL CONFIGURATION (If Domain Issue)

If the issue is with Vercel's SSL setup:

### Check Domain Configuration

1. **Vercel Dashboard** → **brga** → **Domains**
2. Verify domain status shows "Valid Configuration"
3. Check nameservers are pointing to Vercel

### Expected DNS Configuration

```
Type: CNAME
Name: batonrougega.org
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

### Force SSL Renewal (If Needed)

1. Remove domain from Vercel
2. Wait 5 minutes
3. Re-add domain
4. Wait for SSL propagation (up to 24 hours)

## WORKAROUNDS FOR WORK COMPUTER

### 1. Mobile Hotspot

- Use personal mobile data to bypass corporate network
- Most effective immediate solution

### 2. Request IT Whitelist

```
Subject: SSL Certificate Whitelist Request - batonrougega.org

Hi IT Team,

I need to access batonrougega.org for work purposes, but I'm getting a certificate error (NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID) due to our corporate SSL inspection.

Could you please whitelist this domain to allow direct SSL connections?

Domain: batonrougega.org
Business justification: [Your reason for accessing the site]

Thank you!
```

### 3. Browser Override (If Permitted)

- Click "Advanced" when certificate warning appears
- Select "Proceed to batonrougega.org (unsafe)"
- **Note**: Only if company policy allows
