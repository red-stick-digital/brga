# DEBUG: Clean Date Update & Admin Add Member Form

**Date Started**: October 23, 2025  
**Issue Reporter**: User  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

---

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Application**: Baton Rouge GA (Gamblers Anonymous) web application  
**Purpose**: Information about meetings, resources for gambling addiction, and members-only section  
**Architecture**: React SPA with Supabase backend

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18.0.0 with Vite 4.0.0
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Date Handling**: date-fns 4.1.0

---

## ISSUE DESCRIPTION

### Problem 1: Profile View Not Updating After Save

- **Symptom**: After updating Clean Date, the new date shows correctly in member directory but doesn't update immediately in the profile view
- **User Impact**: Users think the update failed when it actually succeeded
- **Expected**: Profile view should show updated date immediately after save

### Problem 2: Date Off-By-One Error

- **Symptom**: User had to set date to 7/5/2023 for it to display as 7/4/2023
- **User Impact**: Confusing date entry experience, incorrect dates may be saved
- **Expected**: Selected date should match displayed date (no timezone offset issues)

---

## INVESTIGATION APPROACH

Following debugging philosophy from STARTER.md:

1. ✅ Assume user followed instructions correctly
2. ✅ Assume the code has a bug
3. Check the code/logic BEFORE asking user to retry
4. Document findings

---

## DEBUG LOG

### [10:00] Investigation Start

- [x] Review ProfileForm component (handles date input and save)
- [x] Review ProfileView component (displays saved date)
- [x] Check useMemberProfile hook (data fetching and state management)
- [x] Examine date formatting utilities
- [x] Check for timezone conversion issues

### [10:15] ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED

**Problem 1: Profile View Not Refreshing**

- **File**: `src/hooks/useMemberProfile.js`
- **Issue**: The `updateProfile` function calls `fetchProfile()` after save, but this is async and doesn't wait for completion
- **Result**: The parent component sees old profile data because the fetch hasn't completed yet
- **Line**: 175 - `await fetchProfile();` is called but the success is returned before profile state updates

**Problem 2: Date Off-By-One (Timezone Issue)**

- **File**: `src/components/MemberProfile/ProfileForm.jsx` line 56
- **Issue**: `clean_date: profile.clean_date ? new Date(profile.clean_date).toISOString().split('T')[0] : ''`
- **Problem**: When converting a date string to `new Date()`, JavaScript assumes UTC midnight. When you call `.toISOString()` it converts to UTC, which can shift the date by one day depending on timezone
- **Example**:
  - User selects: 2023-07-04
  - Saved in DB: 2023-07-04
  - Retrieved from DB: "2023-07-04" (string)
  - `new Date("2023-07-04")` creates: 2023-07-04T00:00:00Z (UTC)
  - User in CST (-6 hours) sees: 2023-07-03 18:00:00
  - `.toISOString().split('T')[0]` = "2023-07-03" ❌
- **File**: `src/components/MemberProfile/ProfileView.jsx` line 53
- **Same Issue**: `const cleanDate = new Date(dateString);` suffers from same timezone conversion

---

## ROOT CAUSE

### Issue 1: State Not Updating in UI

The `updateProfile` function in `useMemberProfile.js` returns success immediately after calling `fetchProfile()`, but doesn't wait for the profile state to actually update. The parent component (MemberProfile.jsx) calls `onSuccess()` which exits edit mode, but the ProfileView still shows old data because the fetch is still in progress.

### Issue 2: Timezone Conversion Bug

When displaying dates in both ProfileForm and ProfileView, the code uses `new Date(dateString)` which treats the date as UTC midnight, then converts to local timezone. This causes off-by-one errors for users in timezones behind UTC.

---

## SOLUTION APPLIED

### Fix 1: Timezone Handling for Clean Date

**File**: `src/components/MemberProfile/ProfileForm.jsx` (Line 56)

- **Before**: `clean_date: profile.clean_date ? new Date(profile.clean_date).toISOString().split('T')[0] : ''`
- **After**: `clean_date: profile.clean_date || ''`
- **Rationale**: Database already stores date in YYYY-MM-DD format. No conversion needed. The date input field expects this exact format.

**File**: `src/components/MemberProfile/ProfileView.jsx` (Line 53-57)

- **Before**: `const cleanDate = new Date(dateString);`
- **After**:
  ```javascript
  const [year, month, day] = dateString.split("-").map(Number);
  const cleanDate = new Date(year, month - 1, day); // month is 0-indexed
  ```
- **Rationale**: Parse the date string manually as a local date to avoid timezone conversion. This ensures 2023-07-04 stays as July 4, 2023 regardless of user timezone.

### Fix 2: Profile State Refresh Timing

**File**: `src/hooks/useMemberProfile.js` (Line 175-178)

- **Added**: Small delay after fetchProfile to ensure state propagates
  ```javascript
  await fetchProfile();
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
  ```

**File**: `src/components/MemberProfile/ProfileForm.jsx` (Line 143-149)

- **Changed**: Success message timeout from 2000ms to 1500ms
- **Rationale**: Combined with the 100ms delay in the hook, this gives enough time for the profile state to update before switching back to view mode

---

## TESTING VERIFICATION

To verify these fixes work:

1. **Date Timezone Test**:

   - Set clean date to a specific date (e.g., July 4, 2023)
   - Save the profile
   - Verify the date displays as July 4, 2023 (not July 3 or July 5)
   - Edit again and verify the date input shows July 4, 2023

2. **Profile Refresh Test**:
   - Edit clean date
   - Save the profile
   - Verify the profile view immediately shows the updated date without needing to refresh the page
   - Check that the member directory also shows the correct date

---

## STATUS

✅ **RESOLVED** - Both issues fixed

### Final Solution (Updated after user testing)

After user testing revealed the profile view still wasn't updating, we implemented a more robust solution:

**The Real Problem**: The `ProfileForm` was calling `onSuccess()` immediately after the update completed, which switched back to view mode before the fresh data had loaded. The real-time subscription in `useMemberProfile` would eventually update the data, but the timing was unreliable.

**The Fix**: Moved the responsibility of refreshing profile data to the parent component (`MemberProfile.jsx`), which explicitly calls `fetchProfile()` before switching back to view mode.

### Changes Made

1. **ProfileForm.jsx** - Line 56: Removed timezone conversion, use date string directly
2. **ProfileView.jsx** - Lines 53-57: Parse date as local date to avoid timezone shift
3. **MemberProfile.jsx** - NEW: Added `handleProfileSuccess` function that explicitly fetches fresh profile data before exiting edit mode
4. **ProfileForm.jsx** - Lines 143-149: Made `onSuccess` callback async, reduced timeout to 1000ms
5. **useMemberProfile.js** - Removed automatic `fetchProfile()` call from `updateProfile()` - now handled by parent component

### Code Changes

**File**: `src/pages/MemberProfile.jsx`

```javascript
// Added fetchProfile to destructured hook
const { profile, loading, error, fetchProfile } = useMemberProfile();

// New handler that refreshes before exiting edit mode
const handleProfileSuccess = async () => {
  await fetchProfile();
  setIsEditing(false);
};

// Updated ProfileForm props
<ProfileForm
  profile={profile}
  onCancel={() => setIsEditing(false)}
  onSuccess={handleProfileSuccess} // Changed from inline arrow function
/>;
```

**File**: `src/hooks/useMemberProfile.js`

- Removed the automatic `fetchProfile()` and delay from `updateProfile()`
- Parent components now control when to refresh data

**File**: `src/components/MemberProfile/ProfileForm.jsx`

- Made `onSuccess` callback `async`
- Reduced success message timeout from 1500ms to 1000ms for better UX

### Expected Behavior After Fix

- ✅ Clean date displays correctly without off-by-one errors
- ✅ Profile view updates immediately after saving with fresh data from database
- ✅ Date input shows the exact same date as what's stored in the database
- ✅ Works correctly regardless of user's timezone
- ✅ No page refresh needed - data updates automatically

### Files Modified

- `src/components/MemberProfile/ProfileForm.jsx`
- `src/components/MemberProfile/ProfileView.jsx`
- `src/hooks/useMemberProfile.js`
- `src/pages/MemberProfile.jsx` (NEW)

---

**Resolution Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Verified**: Code changes applied, no linting errors  
**User Testing**: Console shows correct data saving, profile view now refreshes correctly

## ADDITIONAL ISSUE: Admin Add Member Form

### Problem 3: Admin Add Member Form Using Deprecated Fields

**Issue Discovered**: While testing, user noticed the Admin Add Member form still used old `full_name` field and required manual password entry.

**Problems**:

1. Form asked for "Full Name" instead of separate first/middle/last name fields
2. Admin had to manually create a password for new members
3. New members didn't receive password setup email like migrated users

**Solution Applied**:

**File**: `src/components/Admin/AddMemberForm.jsx`

1. **Updated Form Fields**:

   - Removed `full_name` field
   - Added `first_name`, `middle_initial`, `last_name` fields
   - Layout changed to 3-column grid for name fields

2. **Removed Password Field**:

   - Removed password input and show/hide toggle
   - Removed EyeIcon and EyeSlashIcon imports
   - Removed `showPassword` state variable

3. **Automatic Password Reset Email**:

   - Generate random temporary password during account creation
   - Automatically send password reset email after account creation
   - Added helper text: "A password reset email will be sent to this address after account creation."

4. **Updated Validation**:
   - Removed password validation
   - Added first_name validation (required)
   - Added last_name validation (required)
   - Added middle_initial validation (max 1 character)

**Code Changes**:

```javascript
// Generate temporary password
const tempPassword =
  Math.random().toString(36).slice(-12) + Math.random().toString(36).slice(-12);

// Create member
const result = await createMember(email, tempPassword, profileData);

// Send password reset email
if (result.success) {
  const resetResult = await requestPasswordReset(email);
  // Continue even if email fails (log warning only)
}
```

**Files Modified**:

- `src/components/Admin/AddMemberForm.jsx`

**Expected Behavior**:

- ✅ Admin enters first name, middle initial (optional), and last name
- ✅ Admin doesn't need to create a password
- ✅ New member receives password reset email automatically
- ✅ Consistent with CSV migration workflow
- ✅ Better user experience for both admin and new member

---

5. ⚠️ Foreign key constraint violation on member profile creation - IN PROGRESS

---

## ONGOING ISSUE: Foreign Key Constraint Error

### Problem 4: Member Creation Foreign Key Violation (STILL OCCURRING)

**Issue Discovered During Testing**: When admin tried to add a new member, got error:

```
insert or update on table "member_profiles" violates foreign key constraint "member_profiles_user_id_fkey"
```

**Initial Hypothesis**:
The `signUp()` function creates the auth user asynchronously, and the code was immediately trying to insert into `member_profiles` before the auth.users record was fully committed to the database. The foreign key constraint on `member_profiles.user_id` references `auth.users.id`, so if that user isn't fully committed yet, the insert fails.

**Attempts to Fix**:

### Attempt 1: Added Delay and Retry Logic

**File**: `src/hooks/useUserManagement.js` - `createMember` function

1. **Added delay after user creation**:
   - Wait 500ms after signUp to allow auth user to be committed
2. **Implemented retry logic for profile creation**:

   - Try to create profile up to 3 times with 1 second delays
   - Handles timing issues with async user creation
   - Logs retry attempts for debugging

3. **Better error handling**:
   - Check that `authData.user` exists before proceeding
   - Better error messages with context
   - Removed invalid `admin.deleteUser()` call (doesn't work with anon key)

**Code Changes**:

```javascript
// Wait for auth user to be committed
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500));

// Retry logic for profile creation
let retries = 3;
while (retries > 0) {
    const { error } = await supabase.from('member_profiles').insert({...});

    if (!error) break;

    retries--;
    if (retries > 0) {
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
    }
}
```

**Result**: ❌ FAILED - Still getting foreign key constraint error after all 3 retries

**Console Output**:

```
Created user with ID: 71373249-3194-456c-a3b0-d027ed0a9267
Profile creation failed, retrying... (2 attempts left)
Profile creation failed, retrying... (1 attempts left)
Failed to create profile after retries
Error: Failed to create member profile: insert or update on table "member_profiles"
violates foreign key constraint "member_profiles_user_id_fkey"
```

**Analysis**: The retry logic is working, but even after 500ms + 3 retries with 1-second delays (total ~3.5 seconds), the auth.users record still doesn't exist for the foreign key to reference.

---

### ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION

The real issue appears to be **architectural**, not timing-related:

**Problem**: When using `supabase.auth.signUp()` with an **anon key** (which is what the client-side app uses):

1. The user is created in `auth.users` table
2. BUT the foreign key constraint on `member_profiles.user_id` might be checking against a different auth schema or the user record isn't visible to the anon key's RLS policies
3. Even though we can see the user ID returned from signUp, the database-level foreign key constraint can't reference it

**Evidence**:

- User ID is successfully returned: `71373249-3194-456c-a3b0-d027ed0a9267`
- The insert fails with 409 (Conflict) due to foreign key constraint
- Retry logic runs but never succeeds
- Error persists even after 3+ seconds

**The Actual Problem**:
We're trying to use **client-side signup** for an **admin function**. The proper solution requires **server-side user creation** with service role credentials, not client-side anon key.

---

### PLANNED SOLUTION

We need to move user creation to a **server-side function** that uses the **service role key**:

**Option 1: Create Supabase Edge Function** (Recommended)

- Create a server-side Edge Function with service role access
- Admin calls the Edge Function to create users
- Edge Function uses `supabase.auth.admin.createUser()` which properly commits to auth.users
- Then creates profile and role records

**Option 2: Use Database Trigger** (Alternative)

- Remove manual profile/role creation from client
- Create database trigger on auth.users insert
- Trigger automatically creates member_profiles and user_roles records
- But this requires passing profile data through auth metadata

**Option 3: Direct Database Function** (Quick Fix)

- Create a PostgreSQL function that runs with elevated privileges
- Function creates auth user and profile in a single transaction
- Call from client using RPC

---

### CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Database Trigger Already Exists!

**Found**: There IS a database trigger `handle_new_user()` that should automatically create `member_profiles` and `user_roles` when a new user signs up!

**File**: `database/fix_trigger_roles_creation_v2.sql`

**What the trigger does**:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Auto-create member_profiles entry
    INSERT INTO public.member_profiles (user_id, email)
    VALUES (NEW.id, NEW.email)
    ON CONFLICT (user_id) DO NOTHING;

    -- Auto-create user_roles entry
    INSERT INTO public.user_roles (user_id, role, approval_status)
    VALUES (NEW.id, 'member', 'pending')
    ON CONFLICT (user_id) DO NOTHING;

    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

**The Real Problem**: Our code is trying to manually insert into `member_profiles` AFTER the trigger already created a basic profile. We're getting a conflict (409) because the profile already exists!

**Evidence**:

- Error code is 409 (Conflict), not 404 or permission error
- The trigger uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` so it creates a minimal profile
- Our code then tries to insert a full profile with all fields, causing the conflict

---

### ACTUAL ROOT CAUSE

The `createMember` function in `useUserManagement.js` is trying to:

1. Create user via signUp() ✅
2. Trigger auto-creates minimal profile ✅
3. **Our code tries to INSERT full profile** ❌ (CONFLICT - profile already exists!)
4. Our code tries to INSERT user_role ❌ (CONFLICT - role already exists!)

**We should be using UPDATE, not INSERT!**

---

### CORRECT SOLUTION

Instead of INSERT, we need to UPDATE the existing profile that the trigger created:

```javascript
// After signUp completes and trigger runs...

// UPDATE the profile (not INSERT)
const { error: profileError } = await supabase
  .from("member_profiles")
  .update({
    first_name: profileData.first_name,
    middle_initial: profileData.middle_initial,
    last_name: profileData.last_name,
    phone: profileData.phone,
    clean_date: profileData.clean_date,
    home_group_id: profileData.home_group_id,
    listed_in_directory: profileData.listed_in_directory,
    willing_to_sponsor: profileData.willing_to_sponsor,
  })
  .eq("user_id", userId);

// UPDATE the role approval status (not INSERT)
const { error: roleError } = await supabase
  .from("user_roles")
  .update({
    approval_status: "approved",
    notes: "Manually added by admin",
  })
  .eq("user_id", userId);
```

---

### Attempt 2: Change INSERT to UPDATE (CORRECT SOLUTION)

**Implementation**: Modified `useUserManagement.js` `createMember` function

**Changes Made**:

1. **Removed INSERT logic** - No longer trying to create profiles/roles manually
2. **Added UPDATE logic** - Update the profiles/roles that the trigger created
3. **Increased delay** - Changed from 500ms to 1000ms to ensure trigger completes
4. **Better logging** - Added success messages to track flow

**Code Changes**:

```javascript
// Wait for database trigger to complete (1 second)
await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));

// UPDATE profile (not INSERT)
const { error: profileError } = await supabase
  .from("member_profiles")
  .update({
    first_name: profileData.first_name,
    middle_initial: profileData.middle_initial,
    last_name: profileData.last_name,
    phone: profileData.phone,
    clean_date: profileData.clean_date,
    home_group_id: profileData.home_group_id,
    listed_in_directory: profileData.listed_in_directory,
    willing_to_sponsor: profileData.willing_to_sponsor,
  })
  .eq("user_id", userId);

// UPDATE role to approved (not INSERT)
const { error: roleError } = await supabase
  .from("user_roles")
  .update({
    approval_status: "approved",
    notes: "Manually added by admin",
  })
  .eq("user_id", userId);
```

**Files Modified**:

- `src/hooks/useUserManagement.js`

**Expected Result**: ✅ Should work! The trigger creates minimal profile/role, we just update with full details.
